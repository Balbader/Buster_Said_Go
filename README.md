# Buster Said Go
[The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) Bootcamp Final Project Presentation

Welcome and thank you for taking the time to check us out ^^ <br>

The following is our final project presentation for what we believe is an amazing idea. <br>

We truly hope that this presentation will create in you the desire to follow us in crafting an amazing solution <br>
to one of the greatest problems ever encountered by students, specially in the actual health crisis: STUDENT LOANS! <br>

## Problem
Following a study by [l'Unef](https://unef.fr/) and [l'Observatoire National de la Vie Etudiante](http://www.ove-national.education.fr/situation-economique-et-financiere-des-etudiant%c2%b7e%c2%b7s-de-nouvelles-donnees-disponibles-2/), <br>
there is between 200 and 300 thousands students that seeks a student loan <br>
to finance their post-bac studies. This amounts to about 10% of the student population of the country. <br>
Adding to that the current economic crisis due to the pandemic, earning money is harder than ever. <br>

## Our Solution
Welcome to Buster Said Go! <br>
The Crowdfunding Quiz Game to help students pay off their student loan and <br>
earn some cash on the side. <br>

# The Idea

## Description
Like life, Buster Said Go! is a team game.

1. At the beginning of each game, you get matched with 2 random player
2. You independently answer general-purpose trivia statements True or False within a 10-second time limit
3. Rack up as many points as you can. The game is over after three incorrect answers
4. A game lasts 7 days. This is called the inner cycle
5. At the end of each inner cycle, the team with the highest points count wins the weeky money prize
