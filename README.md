The Hacking Project Bootcamp Final Project Presentation

Welcome and thank you for taking the time to check us out ^^ <br>

The following is our final project presentation for what we believe is an <br>
amazing idea. <br>

We truly hope that this presentation will create in you the desire to follow <br>
us in crafting an amazing solution to one of the greatest problems ever encountered <br>
by students, specially in the actual health crisis: <br>
STUDENT LOANS! <br><br>

## Problem
Following a study by [l'Unef](https://unef.fr/) and [l'Observatoire National de la Vie Etudiante](http://www.ove-national.education.fr/situation-economique-et-financiere-des-etudiant%c2%b7e%c2%b7s-de-nouvelles-donnees-disponibles-2/), <br>
there is between 200 and 300 thousands students that seeks a student loan <br>
to finance their post-bac studies. This amounts to about 10% of the student population of the country. <br>
Adding to that the current economic crisis due to the pandemic, earning money is harder than ever. <br>
